# Configuration Service

## Purpose

A centralized configuration management service designed to provide flexible, secure, and scalable configuration storage for applications across the organization.

## Vision

To create a unified, dynamic configuration management system that supports diverse application types and enables seamless, centralized configuration control.

## Supported Application Types

The Configuration Service is designed to support configurations for:
- Mobile Applications
- Desktop Applications
- Web Applications
- Cloud Services
- Microservices

## Core Objectives

1. **Centralized Configuration Management**
   - Provide a single source of truth for application configurations
   - Enable dynamic configuration updates
   - Streamlined configuration management

2. **Flexibility and Scalability**
   - Support various application types and architectures
   - Flexible configuration data structure
   - Provide a consistent interface for configuration management

3. **Security and Reliability**
   - Ensure secure storage and retrieval of configuration data
   - Validate and sanitize configuration inputs
   - Maintain configuration integrity across different environments

## Configuration Model

### Key Characteristics
- Flexible key-value configuration storage
- Simple and complex configuration values
- Dynamically typed configuration values

### Example Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "database_url": "postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp",
  "api_endpoint": "https://api.example.com",
  "features": {
    "dark_mode": true,
    "notifications": false
  }
}
```

## Strategic Benefits

- **Simplified Configuration Management**
  - Centralize configuration across different applications
  - Reduce configuration complexity
  - Enable easier updates and maintenance

- **Enhanced Deployment Flexibility**
  - Support multiple application types
  - Allow for environment-specific configurations
  - Facilitate easier scaling and migration

## Administration

The Configuration Service includes a REST API that allows applications to:
- Register new applications in the system
- Retrieve configuration data by application and environment
- Update configuration values dynamically
- Query configurations with filtering options

## Guiding Principles

- **Simplicity**: Easy to use and integrate
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various application needs
- **Security**: Robust input validation and data protection
- **Scalability**: Designed to grow with organizational needs

## Implementation Overview

This service is built using:
- **Backend**: TypeScript, Express.js, PostgreSQL
- **Architecture**: RESTful API with MVC pattern
- **Security**: Input validation, CORS, security headers
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive test coverage
- **Deployment**: Docker support for easy deployment
