# Integrate learning with reflection

Module 1: 
1. What surprised you?
I was impressed at how well the assistant did at figuring out why tests might be failing and fixing its code appropriately
2. What frustrated you?
I need MUCH better skills at getting the assistant to follow certain commands that I thought were very straightforward, like "please place the new code in this existing directory". 
The assistant's sublime overconfidence - "This task is complete! All the tests are passing!" when only 9/30 tests were passing...
3. How would you rate your planning efforts?
I actually forgot about using the assistant to plan the prompt, so I restarted with this approach after I'd already got a service running. I probably could have spend more time on this prompt refinement - the assistant didn't come up with much more than I already had done myself
4. Did you experience any overwhelm?
Yes, all that generated code! So incredibly boring to review! I couldn't bring myself to read it all, or even read through the tests. I realised that I don't mind reading other humans' code because it gives an interesting window into their personality and approach, but reading the assistant's code... ugghhh!
5. How did you find not hand-writing code?
Disliked intensely, but pushed through!
6. How will this experience influence you going forward?
I haven't found the fun or the usefulness yet... but it's only day 1 so I'm keeping an open mind! 

Before the next time we meet, please post a link to your repo and your reflections to Discord.
